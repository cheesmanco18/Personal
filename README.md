# FINTECH CASE STUDY: SQUARE

## Overview and Origin

* The parent company, Block, includes Square, Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL and TBD. For the purposes of this case study I will hone in on Square.

* Square was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey

* Jack McKelvey was running a glass shop when a woman placed a $3,000 order with him. She asked to pay with American Express, and Jack had to ask her to go find a new payment method because he couldn't accept Amex (processing fees were way too high). He eventually lost the sale. He described the issue to Twitter Co-founder, Jack Dorsey, who was looking for a new idea. They decided to build a payment system that made accepting payment easier for small businesses (lower fees, easier adminstration and compliance adherance)

* Square is now a public company and raised about $600M in equity and debt financing until its IPO in 2019

## Business Activities:

* Square started out with the goal of enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale. It now serves as a partner for businesses of all sizes, helping them grow through payment processing, banking and other financial solutions, with a focus on simplifying commerce through tech.

* The majority of Square's customers are small (0-9 employees) commerce companies located in the U.S. Within the POS Systems space it has 23.5% market share. Toast, Revention and Apple Pay are other key players in the space.

* Square has a bit of a competitive advantage through its product ecosystem. Because it offers a variety of products, it can charge low fees on things such as payment processing, because it will eventually monetize those customers with its other solutions. Moreover, it was initially built for new/small businesses, so it can grow with its customer base as their businesses do.

* Square uses a variety of technologies, including Amazon EC2, Snowflake, Jira, and more ([stackshare](https://stackshare.io/square/square)). It also uses credit card reading technologies like NFC and EMV ([SquareUp](https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/how-do-credit-card-readers-work))


## Landscape:

* Square is mainly in the payments domain within fintech, but has started to expand to other areas like digital banking

* Trends within the payments domain include: increasing real-time customer payment options; digital identities; new money moving technologies and digital currencies; and innovation moving too quickly for regulation

* Some key performance indicators for Square include number of merchants, number of transactions, value per transaction, customer lifetime value

* Square is generating revenue at a higher rate than its competitors, however its stock has underperformed its peers. This is likely due to a higher valaution starting point and private nature of many of its other competitors

## Recommendations

* I would advise Square to continue to build out its payment and financing solutions for non-traditional sellers. Big banks have a strong hold on traditional, large corporate players, but if Square focuses on small business and new forms of business (ex. content creators) it can build a moat in the area, while remaining nimble, enjoying growth with its customers, and maintaining a tech-forward approach. 

* Doing the above may mean adopting the use of alternative forms of currency (i.e. digital currencies). This, along with the use of blockchain, should alleviate issues of trust and lower the cost and time to settlement which are inherently important to smaller merchants.
